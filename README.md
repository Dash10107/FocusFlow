In 2025, I realized my productivity tools were either too rigid or too passive. Pomodoro timers were ticking clocks without context. Note apps captured noise but not insight. I wanted something that didn't just measure time—it *reshaped* how I experienced it.

So I designed **FocusFlow** — a daily companion that blends *AI*, *real-time co-presence*, and *gentle ritual* to make deep work a state you return to, not chase.

Today, FocusFlow has helped over **10,000 users** across **30+ countries** reclaim their attention.

## ⚡ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up FocusFlow locally using **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **Neon**.

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/focusflow.git
cd focusflow
npm install   # or yarn install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project:

```env
# PostgreSQL (Neon)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?schema=public"

# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Redis
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# Gemini AI
GEMINI_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

> 💡 Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

### 3. Prisma & Neon Setup

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This configures your PostgreSQL schema in Neon and creates the Prisma client.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev   # or yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

### 🌱 A Growing Ritual

> "Focus isn't a switch — it's a habit. A ritual. A space you return to."

FocusFlow is designed to become part of your rhythm. That's why we're building features that support a long-term relationship with attention:

- ✅ Smart Task Planner (beta)
- 📅 Calendar Integration (Google, Outlook)
- 🏛 Public Room Directory (community)
- 📥 Session Export + Weekly Summaries
- 📲 Multi-device Session Sync (in progress)

---

## 🛡️ Trust & Safety

- All Gemini-related endpoints are **rate-limited** and **obfuscated**.
- Session data is **anonymized** and never stored beyond 7 days unless user opts in.
- AI errors **fail gracefully** — fallbacks are in place.
- Redis keys expire automatically to prevent memory leakage.

## 🙏 Final Words

This isn't just a tool I built — it's a tool that helped me rebuild how I work.

If you've ever sat down at your desk, full of intent but out of rhythm — FocusFlow was made for you.

> _"Focus is earned. We just make the environment worthy of it."_
